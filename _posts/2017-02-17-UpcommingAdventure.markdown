One of the greatest things my university does is they force us to go work in the
industry before we can graduate. This is commonly referred to as a coop, and thanks
to it I already have just under a year of experience working in the Aerospace
Industry despite only being 20 years old. This week was special however because 
I finally decided on where my Summer coop will be! 

I've accepted a position with The Aerospace Corporation, all the way out in El Segundo,
Los Angeles, California. Even more exciting, I'll be driving out there rather than flying.
The concept of taking a week long trip to drive across the country is both intimidating
and exhilerating; It's a dream many Americans have and I feel privledged to have this
opportunity so early on in life. 

Luckily, I still have 3 months to plan everything out :)
