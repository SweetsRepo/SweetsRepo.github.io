<img src="/images/fulls/01.jpg" class="fit image"> Welcome to SweetsRepo! My
name is Christopher Sweet and at the time of writing I am an aspiring Computer
Engineer at Rochester Institute of Technology. This blog will serve to detail
my adventures when coding, studying, and researching. I hope to use this as a 
log, forcing myself to write about what my current projects are as well as the
inevitable bugs that come with them. 

Additionally I may just post here to post. I've included a picture of Atlas
above that I took while in New York City recently. I've been reading this book
Atlas Shrugged which is really quite a wonderful read. Would highly recommend 
it to anyone who thinks they have an engineering and work oriented mindset. 

Anyways, guess that's enough rambling for now. Hope you enjoy!
