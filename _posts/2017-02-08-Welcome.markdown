<img src="/images/fulls/01.jpg" class="fit image"> Welcome to SweetsRepo! My
name is Christopher Sweet and at the time of writing I am an aspiring Computer
Engineer at Rochester Institute of Technology. This blog will serve to detail
my adventures when coding, studying, and researching. I hope to use this as a 
log, forcing myself to write about what my current projects are as well as the
inevitable bugs that come with them. Hope you enjoy!
